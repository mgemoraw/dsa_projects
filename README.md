# Data Structure in C++ projects

->The problem questions are included inside the ```problems.txt``` file

If you haven't added gcc/g++ compiler in the system path, please add it first. To check if the compiler is in the system path of your machine 
- execute ```g++ --version``` in the command line terminal (cmd for windows)


## usage
use command line terminal to compile and link the files
for windows and linux systems follow these steps

## Usage or student data structure
1. compile the files including all functions using g++
2. example : ```g++  student.cpp utils.cpp -o student ```
3. use   ``` ./student ``` to run the executable file or simply double click on ```student.exe``` file on windows
