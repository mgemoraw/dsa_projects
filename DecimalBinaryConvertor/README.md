# Data Structure in C++ projects

->The problem questions are included inside the ```problems.txt``` file

If you haven't added gcc/g++ compiler in the system path, please add it first. To check if the compiler is in the system path of your machine 
- execute ```g++ --version``` in the command line terminal (cmd for windows)


## usage
use command line terminal to compile and link the files
for windows and linux systems follow these steps


## Usage for decimal to binary stack data structure
1. compile the files including all functions using g++
2. example : ```g++  dec_bin.cpp utils.cpp -o tobin ```
3. use   ``` ./tobin ``` to run the executable file  or simply double click on ```tobin.exe``` file on windows

<b>Tips: You may ignore all the header files and combine all in one single ```.cpp``` file if you use Codeblocks and other IDEs for simplicity </b>
