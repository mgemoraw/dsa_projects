# Data Structure Assignemnt
## Direction:-
- Submitted individually
- In each question, unless the data structure is specified, you can select from well known data structure or you can use your own invented data structure to implement the program.

1. which sorting algorithm is best to sort 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,7,9,20,30 and why?.

2. Show the necessary steps how to sort the following Array list using Bubble and Insertion Sort Algorithm 7, 2, 8, 5, 4, 6

3. Write a C++ linked list program that implements student ADT with properties id, name, father name, sex, CGPA, etc. The ADT has also the following operation
A) Add operation that add a student wherever required
B) Delete operation that deletes an academic dismissal student ie. If his/her CGPA is less than
1.75;
C) Search operation that accept student name then search and display his/here information.
D) Display operation that displays student information in the linked list.
E) Sort operation that sort students linked list by their name in ascending order (use either ofsearching technique.

4. Implement towns linked list from BahirDar to Addis Ababa. Each town record contain the name of the town, distance from its neighbor, longitude and latitudes. Your program should
implement operations of insertion, deletion ,searching by name and displaying all town
informationâ€™s. Write another operation to accept the starting and destination town and display the distance between them (use linked list).

5. Chiss Abay Garage is found at Bahirdar city . This garage has one entrance and one exit gates. Its parking which used to hold the repaired cars as a queue serves only a single car(does not allow two cars parked parallelly). The garage uses first come first served data structure principle (FIFO). write a c++ program that stores the car information like plate number, type of cars,
owner of the car, arrival time. Your program should implement the following operations.
a) To add the car in the queue when new car is arrived.
b) Display all cars in the queue.
c) To search the care using his plate number and display ordered number from the first car in the list.
d) To restructure the list. If the car wanted urgently before served or repaired, all cars behind it
will be out of the parking then returned back to the queue as previous order after removing it from the list (use stack ).

6. Write a C++ program that accepts a decimal number then convert and display its binary
number. Use repeatedly division by two. The program should use stack principle to store the
reminder.
