To run the codes you have to include the header files and the .cpp files in the same working directory so that the compiler could find header file.

# Example 
>>> for student.cpp file header file is student.h
>>> compile student.cpp putting student.h in the same working directory
>>> run the executable.
>>> You can use IDEs like codeblocks or VSCode to compile and run

Thank you for using the code
